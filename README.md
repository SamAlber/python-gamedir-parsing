# Python-Scripting-Project

This script prompts the user for a file path for a directory which has games and other files.
The script will find the directories in that directory that have 'game' in their name and extract a new name without the 'game' element.
The target directory will be created if it's not there yet(or overwritten) and a new directory with the game name will be created in the
target directory (without the 'game' in the dir's name) with all of it's contents
+
Writing a JSON file that has metadata about the games. (What the game directories are and how many of them exist)
+
Compiling the code inside of a directory and running it using a subprocess
